                    A multi-million dollar facilities upgrade which begun in the spring of 2012 supports a reinvigorated arts integration and museum program and space for art, music, drama, exhibits, and a high-tech media center. A $1.5 million technology upgrade in 2010-2011 provided SMART boards for every classroom, document cameras, SMART response systems, enhanced sound systems, a Mac lab, and iPads for classroom use. Our renovated auditorium provides performance space. Students play and exercise outdoors on a new 13,200-square-foot field donated by the Synthetic Turf Council.

                    Teachers partner with organizations and individuals throughout the city to create exciting and varied learning opportunities. A highlight of sixth grade is the Embassy Adoption Program, where students visit a country’s embassy and experience its culture and food through field trips and projects. Seventh graders enjoy outdoor experiential learning through the help of partners like Living Classrooms, Provider Pals, and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation. Eighth grade teachers sustain partnerships with the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum and We the People Trolley Tour to enhance students’ engagement with the Constitution and civics. Additional learning partners include Arena Stage, Folger Shakespeare Library, Smithsonian American Art Museum, National Portrait Gallery, the National Wildlife Federation, Center for Inspired Teaching, and Learning Tree.

                    The Washington Post recently highlighted Stuart-Hobson as having a large proportion of students who are advanced in reading and math. Students have boasted the city’s second highest DC-CAS test scores among DC’s public middle schools for the past three years. Graduates go on to succeed at top public and private high schools.
Stuart-Hobson’s rigorous academic program includes Spanish as a core subject every year. All students complete pre-algebra by the end of eighth grade. Seventh and eighth grade students can earn high school credit by successfully completing the end-of-course Spanish and Algebra I exams.
Teachers and staff support social-emotional growth and learning through Positive Behavior Interventions and Supports (PBIS).
